This project is a quiz within the HTML browser, powered by Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

The page loads a simple display, with a time, link to high scores and a start button

When you select an answer you are told if you are correct or incorrect, and the next question is displayed after a short time.

At the end your score is calculated and a prompt for your initials is given to save your initials and score into local storage
